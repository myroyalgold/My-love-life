# My-love-life

Pain upon pain, she feels lost without any worries to distract her. Living like a shadow, she questions why she even wakes up and wonders if there is life after death. She appears homeless and heartbroken, disappointed by loved ones who always see her as a fault. Despite this, people find peace in her presence and her brothers love her dearly. People feel comfortable around her and wish she were part of their family, as she always goes the extra mile for others.

It can be very difficult and painful when someone you love tells you that they don't feel comfortable or at peace with you because of their friendship with someone of the opposite gender. It's natural to feel hurt and confused in this situation.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own boundaries and comfort levels when it comes to relationships and friendships. While it may be difficult for you to understand or accept, it's possible that your loved one's feelings are valid and should be respected.

Starting a new life can be a big decision, and it's important to take the time to think through your options. 
It may also be helpful for you making new friends especially the opposite gender and make yourself comfortable around them too so that they can help you work through your feelings and navigate this difficult situation.

Remember, it's okay to feel hurt and upset, but it's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being when friends and others do not believe what youâ€™ve seen  and go through because of the trust they had in him and keep on blaming you for that one wrong way you did to prove the validity and never discuss about his wrong deeds.

As a general rule, it's important not to beg for love or to show too much care in a relationship, as this may cause your partner to take your love and affection for granted. 

As someone who experiences emotions deeply, it's important to find ways to distract yourself from things that may cause you to feel sad or upset, as dwelling on these things can be damaging to your well-being.

Instead, focus on building yourself up in a way that makes it clear to your partner that you are a valuable and important person. By prioritizing your own needs and interests, you can help your partner see that you are not someone to be taken for granted.

Remember that your life is your own, and you deserve to be happy and fulfilled regardless of what happens in your relationships. By taking care of yourself first, you can create a stable foundation for your life and build healthy relationships with others.
